+ make bouncy scale animation (that does NOT affect the collision box) for Player, to be used each time you gain a point (ie collect a thing)
+ chain: if you collect 3 of the same food in a row, get a temporary bonus (bigger score, special foods, no neg items or all of these); have ui slots below score that update to show the last 3 collected foods (they don't update while the bonus is active)
- faster!!!: every n seconds or spawns, temporarily increase the speed (decrease spawn time and maybe gravity drag) by a lot (keep incremental 13 second speedups - those are separate)
- change lighting depending on how much time has passed or how many points were collected
- have stickers (or models) of pandas, food or japanese things fill up sides of the screen and dance when something cool happens
